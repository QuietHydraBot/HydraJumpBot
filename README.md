## Features
- **Pack Rolling** — Pick 1 pack from random choices, then roll again for the second pack.
- **Hydra Demo Packs** — A built-in demo set to test it out.
- **Pack Management** — Add, edit, and delete packs with Name, Theme, Colors, and Set/Box info.
- **Fair RNG Mode** — In theory, it balances rolls so underused packs get more chances.

- **Filtering & Sorting** — Filter by set/box or colors, sort your collection for easy browsing.
- **Import/Export** — Backup or restore your collection with JSON or CSV.
